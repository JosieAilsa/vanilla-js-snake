/*1. When user clicks start get rid of the start div

//2. Create new apple in a random location

//3.Create the static snake
    // -appendChild to main board container
    //- Set its size based on row/col start/end 
    //Give it a background colour - 
    //For the head have a seperate class with an svg bg image

4. Set up the logic of how the snake will move
        Every second .25 a second if a button is pressed the the snake will move:
                 If the previous key was up/down :
                    Can move +1 or -1 x
                 If the previous key was left or right:
                    Can move +1 or -1 y 
    
                        
Each iteration + or - 1 to x coordinate if the l or r arrow is pressed 
Each iteration + or - 1 to y coordinate if the up or down arrow is pressed 

    If the snake hits x or y coordinate of 1 or 25 = game over
    if snakeHead === x & y of other snake body also game over 

    if snakeHead === x&y of apple = points aded to scores string 

5. Create the snake with the logic from above
    //To make snake move change the grid area of each part 
    
    Add score string to the innerhtml
